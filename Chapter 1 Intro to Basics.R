###Chapter 1 Intro to Basics

###How It Works
# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6+12

###Arithmetic With R
# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

# A division
(5 + 5)/2 

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28%%6

###Variable Assignment
# Assign the value 42 to 'x'
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable 'x'
x

###Variable Assignment (2)
# Assign the value 5 to the variable called 'my_apples'
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable 'my_apples'
my_apples

###Variable Assignment (3)
# Assign a value to the variables called 'my_apples' and 'my_oranges'
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together and print the result
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable 'my_fruit'
my_fruit

###Apples And Oranges
# Assign a value to the variable called 'my_apples'
my_apples <- 5 

# Print out the value of 'my_apples'
my_apples       

# Assign a value to the variable 'my_oranges' and print it out
my_oranges <- 6 
my_oranges 

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit

###Basic Data Types In R
#Decimal values like 4.5 are numerics.
#Natural numbers like 4 are integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are logical values.
#Text(or string) values are called characters.

# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- "universe"

my_logical <- FALSE

###What's That Data Type?
#class() function checks data types of a variable
# Declare variables of different types:
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
